Both Madhur Jaffrey and Maria Teresa Menezes take a different approach, boiling the masala mix with water and onions in the latter case or coconut milk in Madhur's recipe, before adding the fish."

            "instruction": "Although both are delicious, I think that without frying the masala you lose some of its aromatic qualities – after all, to take just one of the ingredients, garlic is far more flavourful fried than poached. I do love the tadka in Menezes' dish though: curry leaves, ginger and mustard seeds, fried in hot oil until sizzling and aromatic, then stirred into the finished dish: it really lifts the flavours. The more spice the better, as far as I'm concerned."

Vivek Singh uses a mixture of fish stock and coconut milk, which I think makes the coconut flavour too subtle – I want my curry to taste of one of those glorious Goan beaches. It certainly takes me back."
