Press the ball out into a fat round disc, then pick it up and gently turn and stretch it to 30cm in diameter, using gravity to help you. Stretch it over the back of your fists, then place on a floured pizza paddle or board – the dough should be a little thicker around the edges. Pull it into shape and give it a jiggle so you know it’s free-moving. Working quickly and with restraint, add your chosen toppings. Quickly shunt on to your pizza stone and close the oven door to retain heat. Wait 7 or 8 minutes and it’ll be golden, crisp and ready to eat."
