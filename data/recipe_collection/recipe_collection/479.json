During the first lockdown, my colleague Ixta Belfrage came up with this recipe in homage to her two favourite dishes there: biang biang noodles and cucumber salad with special sesame sauce. It became a bit of a viral sensation, as people all over the world took to Instagram to pull and slap their own noodles. It’s important to use a plain flour with 10-12% protein – any less than 10 %, and the dough will rip, rather than stretch (you can find the protein levels in the nutritional information on the side of the packet). Don’t worry if the noodles rip at the ends – they’ll still taste great with the sauces. The technique takes practice, and you’ll get better as you make them, I promise. (You can find step-by-step video guides on Ixta’s Instagram story highlights.)"
