Using potato starch (note, not potato flour; you can substitute cornstarch) helps makes these not only fluffy and light, but also happens to be gluten-free. You can use regular wheat flour if you don't have a problem with wheat, although you will likely need to use more—double and even up to 250 grams, depending on the humidity of your dough."
